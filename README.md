# FibonacciGenerator 1.0

This is a toy project with a helper class and associated console application. It prints Fibonacci numbers. I wrote it to practice:

* TDD
* Setting up MSTest from scratch
* Using the GitHub extension to work in Visual Studio
* C# data types

## Usage

There are three ways you could use this application:

1. Load the solution into Visual Studio and then Debug menu -> Start Debugging
2. Use the precompiled .exe in bin/Debug
3. Copy the code from the three .CS source code files into your own solution (you may need to add references for the unit testing and System.Web)
