# FibonacciGenerator 1.0

This is a helper class and associated console application which print an arbitary number of Fibonacci numbers. I wrote these as an exercise for me to practice:

* TDD
* Setting up MSTest from scratch
* Getting the GitHub extension to work in Visual Studio
* Etc.

## Usage

Assuming you have the solution loaded, run the program by: clicking the green triangle + Start button in the toolbar in Visual Studio, or clicking Debug -> Start Debugging in the menus, or pressing F5. A console window with the running program will appear.
