# FibonacciGenerator 1.0

This is a toy project with a helper class and associated console application that print Fibonacci numbers. I wrote it as an exercise for me to practice:

* TDD
* Setting up MSTest from scratch
* Using the GitHub extension to work in Visual Studio
* Learning about data types

## Usage

You can run the program as a console application, assuming you have the solution loaded in Visual Studio, by:

* clicking the green triangle + Start button in the toolbar
* or clicking Debug -> Start Debugging in the menus
* or pressing F5
 
A console window with the running program will appear.
