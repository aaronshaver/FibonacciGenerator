# FibonacciGenerator 1.0.1

This is a toy project with a helper class and associated console application. It prints Fibonacci numbers. I wrote it to practice:

* TDD
* Setting up MSTest from scratch
* Getting the GitHub extension to work in Visual Studio
* C# data types

## Usage

Copy the code from the three .CS source code files into your own solution (you may need to add references for the unit testing and System.Web) and then run Program.cs
